Only start with Java Collections after you've reviewed the following repositories in order:

	1- Java_Programs
	2- JavaStreams
	

    **************** Nowadays, the trend is knowledge of Java Collections in order to pass automation interviews.****************

	The Java Collections Framework is a collection of interfaces & classes which helps in storing and processing
	the data efficiently. This framework has several useful classes which have TONS of useful methods making
	the programmer's task super easy.
	
    For example, there exists a method to delete a 5th element or add an element between the 5th and
	the 6th one or know the index of a certain element and much more. As you can discern, these are operations
	that can't be performed on an array that is a fixed-length data structure.
	We're going to delve into all that in details.
	
	======================================================================================================================
	Java Collections contain:
	
	1- List Interface. [Elements are added in order. Elements could be duplicates]
	 
		Implemented by the following classes:
			- ArrayList
			- LinkedList
			- Vector
			
	
	2- Set Interface. [The order, in which elements are added, isn't guarenteed. Can NOT contain duplicate elements]
	
		Implemented by the following classes:
		    -HashSet
			-LinkedHashSet
			-TreeSet
			
	3- Map. [For mapping keys to values. can NOT contain duplicate elements]
	
		Implemented by the following classes:
		    -HashMap
		    -TreeMap
		    -LinkedHashMap
		    
 As a Java learner, you need to know Java collections to realize how effective & helpful they are !
